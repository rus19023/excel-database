Excel Database
==============

Excel Database is a Wordpress plugin based on
[Spout](https://github.com/box/spout) for structuring, displaying, and
querying a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet table.

Requirements
------------

It has the same requirements as Spout:
* PHP version 7.1 or higher
* PHP extension `php_zip` enabled
* PHP extension `php_xmlreader` enabled 

It has been tested on Wordpress 5.2

Installing from source
----------------------

```
git clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/traiansf/excel-database
```

The thus obtained `excel-database` directory needs to be placed into
`wp-content/plugins/` from the root of your Wordpress installation.
